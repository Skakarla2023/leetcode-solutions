## 📂 Repository Structure  

The problems are grouped into topic-based folders:  

- 📁 **Arrays** → Problems related to array manipulation, searching, sorting, subarrays, etc.  
- 📁 **Strings** → String operations, pattern matching, palindrome checks, etc.  
- 📁 **Hash-Table** → Problems using hash maps/sets for efficient lookups.  
- 📁 **Dynamic Programming (DP)** → Classic DP problems (knapsack, subsequences, etc.).  
- 📁 **Graphs** → BFS, DFS, shortest path, connected components, etc.  
- 📁 **Linked List** → Linked list operations (reverse, cycle detection, merge, etc.).  
- 📁 **Trees** → Binary tree, BST, traversal, recursion-based problems.  
- 📁 **Recursion / Backtracking** → Subsets, permutations, N-Queens, etc.  
- 📁 **Math & Miscellaneous** → Number theory, bit manipulation, etc.  

Each folder contains solutions in **Java** (and/or Python), with:  
- Problem statement (as a comment at the top)  
- Approach explanation (step-by-step)  
- Code implementation
