This repository contains my solutions to selected **LeetCode problems**, organized by core **problem-solving patterns** for structured DSA preparation.

It is part of my focused **Interview Preparation Journey**, where I aim to master fundamental algorithmic thinking patterns rather than just solving random problems.

## 📁 Folder Descriptions  

- 📁 **Two_Pointers** → Pair problems, palindrome checks, fast & slow pointer techniques, in-place optimizations.  

- 📁 **Sliding_Window** → Fixed and variable window problems involving subarrays and substrings.  

- 📁 **Binary_Search** → Classic binary search, rotated arrays, and binary search on answer space problems.  

- 📁 **Prefix_Sum** → Cumulative sum techniques, range queries, difference arrays, and subarray sum problems.  

- 📁 **Hashing** → Frequency maps, fast lookups, duplicate detection, anagrams, and hash-based optimizations.  

- 📁 **Stack** → Monotonic stack, next greater/smaller element, parentheses validation, and histogram problems.  

- 📁 **Greedy** → Interval scheduling, jump problems, and local-optimal strategy problems.  

- 📁 **Backtracking** → Subsets, permutations, combinations, and constraint-based exploration (e.g., N-Queens).  

- 📁 **Dynamic_Programming** → 1D & 2D DP, knapsack variants, LIS, LCS, optimization and counting problems.  

- 📁 **Graph** → DFS, BFS, topological sorting, union-find, connected components, and shortest path problems.  

Each folder contains solutions in **Java** (primary language), including:

- Problem link  
- Clear approach explanation  
- Step-by-step logic  
- Clean implementation

## ✅ Features  

- Organized by algorithmic patterns (not just data structures).  
- Clean, readable code with structured explanations.  
- Covers essential interview problems across core patterns.  
- Designed for interview readiness and pattern mastery.

## 🚀 How to Use  

1. Navigate to the pattern folder (e.g., `Sliding_Window/`).  
2. Open the problem file.  
3. Review:
   - Problem link  
   - Explanation  
   - Implementation  

You can follow the folders sequentially to build structured mastery.
