# ✅ Valid Anagram Problemn

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

## 🧠 What is an anagram?

Two strings are anagrams if:

- They contain exactly the same characters

- In the same quantity

- But possibly in a different order

### 🔍 Example:

s = "listen"

t = "silent"

#### ✅ Both have the same letters → return true

s = "aacc"

t = "ccac"

#### ❌ Counts don’t match → return false
