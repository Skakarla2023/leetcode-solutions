# 28 Find indexof first occurence of a string

Given 2 strings s1 and s2 we have to return the index of first occurence of s2 in s1, if s2 is a subset of s1 else return -1.

- Here we use the built-in Java method indexOf() to find the index of first occurence of s2 in s1.
- If s2 is not present in s1, this method simpley retunrs -1.
