# ðŸ’¡ 202 Happy Number

- A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.

- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1.

- If it ends in 1, itâ€™s a happy number. Otherwise, itâ€™s not happy.


### ðŸ”¢ Example:

Letâ€™s take n = 19:

```vbnet
Step 1: 1Â² + 9Â² = 1 + 81 = 82
Step 2: 8Â² + 2Â² = 64 + 4 = 68
Step 3: 6Â² + 8Â² = 36 + 64 = 100
Step 4: 1Â² + 0Â² + 0Â² = 1 â†’ âœ… Happy Number
