# 🌟 Problem Statement (in simple terms):

You are given:

A list of numbers (like [1, 2, 3, 1])

A number k (like 3)

Now, you need to check:

- ❓ “Are there any two same numbers in the list that are not too far from each other?”

How far is “too far”?
→ Their positions (indices) should be at most k apart.

### 🔍 Example:

```java
nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]
k = 3
```

The number 1 appears at index 0 and index 3

The distance between them = 3 - 0 = 3

Since 3 <= k, ✅ return true

### 🚫 Another Example:

```java
nums = [1, 0, 1, 1]
k = 1
```

The first 1 is at index 0

The next 1 is at index 2 → Distance = 2 → ❌ too far

Then another 1 is at index 3 → Distance from index 2 = 1 → ✅ return true

### 💡 What are we really doing?

We are saying:

“If I see the same number again, was it seen recently? (within k steps)”

- If yes → return true
- If no → keep going

## 🧠 Why use a HashMap?

Because it helps us remember where we last saw each number, and we can quickly check the distance.

### ✅ Final Summary:
"We look for any two same numbers in the list that are close to each other (within k steps). If we find such a pair, we return true. Otherwise, we return false."
