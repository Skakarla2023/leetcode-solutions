# ðŸ§© 2379 Minimum Recolors to Get K Consecutive Black Blocks

You are given:

- A string made of only two characters:

  - 'B' means a black block

  - 'W' means a white block

- An integer k, which tells you how many consecutive black blocks you want to have.

### ðŸŽ¯ Your Goal:

#### ðŸ‘‰ Find the minimum number of white blocks you need to change (recolor) to black,

so that somewhere in the string, there is a group of k black blocks in a row.

### ðŸ”§ What You Can Do:

- You are allowed to change white blocks ('W') into black ('B'), but you want to do this as few times as possible.

- You donâ€™t need to change the whole string â€” just enough to get k black blocks together somewhere.

### âœ… Example:

Letâ€™s say:

```ini
blocks = "WBBWWB", k = 3
```

We look at every group of 3 blocks:

```
"WBB" â†’ 1 white

"BBW" â†’ 1 white

"BWW" â†’ 2 whites

"WWB" â†’ 2 whites
```

The best group has only 1 white block â†’ so we only need 1 recolor.

#### âœ… Final Answer = 1
