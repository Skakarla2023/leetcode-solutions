# ✅ 9 Palindrome Number Problem 
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

## 🧠 What is a palindrome number?
A number is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.

### 🔍 Examples:

121 → reads the same → ✅ true

-121 → becomes 121- backward → ❌ false

10 → backward is 01 → ❌ false

0 → same both ways → ✅ true

### ⚠️ Key Observations:

- Negative numbers are never palindromes (because of the - sign).

- You should not compare strings unless explicitly allowed — try solving it using math instead.
