# 1.Two Sum

## Brute Force

## Optimised

- Here we use the concept of hashmap,where we store the data in the form of key value pairs.
- First, we calculate the first element and then we calculate the second one by using the formula-sum=first+sec,which means second=sum-first.
- For this we use Hashmap in Java, we'll iterate through the array from beginning and if we did not find the pair of that element, we'll add that into the hashmap, or else if we did find the pair of that element, just return the values.
