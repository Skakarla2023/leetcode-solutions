# 🧩 27 Remove Element 

You are given:

- An array of numbers (e.g., [3, 2, 2, 3])

- A value to remove (e.g., 3)

### 🧠 Your Task:

- Remove all occurrences of that value from the array itself (without using a new array).

- Return the number of elements left in the array after removal.

- You don’t need to return the modified array, but the elements before the returned length should be correct.

### ✨ Example:

```
Input: nums = [3, 2, 2, 3], val = 3
Step-by-step:
Remove all 3s → you’re left with [2, 2]
```

- So the function should return 2, because two elements remain.

- You don’t need to care what comes after those two elements in the array.

### 🛠️ Constraints:

- You must modify the array directly (in-place).

- You can’t use another array to store the result.
