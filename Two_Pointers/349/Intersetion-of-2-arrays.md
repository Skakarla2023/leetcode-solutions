# 🧾 349: Intersection of 2 Arrays

- Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection.
- Each element in the result must be unique, and you may return the result in any order.

### ✅ Example:

Input:

```java
nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1], nums2 = [2, 2]
```

Output:

```java
[2]
```

### 📎Explanation:

The number 2 is present in both arrays.

Even though it appears twice, the output contains only one occurrence (because duplicates aren't allowed in the result).
