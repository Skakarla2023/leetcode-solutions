# 🧠 26. Remove Duplicates from sorted array
You are given a sorted array. You need to remove duplicate elements in-place (without using extra space for another array) and return the number of unique elements. After removing duplicates, the first part of the array should contain only the unique elements.

### ✅ Example:

```
Input: nums = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
Output: 3 (because the unique elements are [1, 2, 3])
```
The array will be changed to: nums = [1, 2, 3, _, _]
(we don’t care what’s after the unique elements)

### 🚀 Key Points:

- The array is already sorted.

- Remove duplicates in-place.

- Return how many unique elements are there.

- Do not return the new array.
