# Two Pointers

- Two Pointers is a widely used problem solving approach that helps us reduce time complexity(especially for solving problems with Linear data structures like Arrays, LinekdList and Strings).
- Instead of solving a problem by exploring all possible ways of solving it, or by checking all possible ways, Two pointers allows us to solve a problem using linear time complexity(O(n)).

## Methods in Two Pointers

**1. Same Direction**

- Slow fast or tortoise hare pointer.
- Detecting cycle in a linked list, middle of a linked list

**2. Opposite Direction**

- Two Sum
- Valid Palidrome
